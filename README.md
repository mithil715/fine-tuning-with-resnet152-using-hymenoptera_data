# fine-tuning-with-resnet152-using-hymenoptera_data
1.we can change the resnet model(152 in use) and can also increase the size of the dataset, the given code classifies between bees and ants
2.The Best accuracy of the given model is 97.3%
3.you can try modifying the code to increase the accuracy on a larger dataset
4.the dataset can be downloaded from Pytorch tutorial of Transfer Learning for Computer Vision.
